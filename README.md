Predicting results for the 2016 Euro Cup 

We built a simple random forest model for the 2016 European Championships. The model is trained on data from the Euro Cup qualifiers (played in 2015) and tested on the actual Euro Cup games played in June and July of 2016. 

The model features takes into account both teamsâ€™ goal differential over the qualifying matches as well as weighted goal differential based on when the qualifying match was played. For instance, a qualifying match that is played in March 2015 has less weight than one in  November 2015.  The response is based on whether the home team wins, loses, or draws in the match. 

We might expand on this model methodology adding schedule strength, fatigue, and player skill level for predicting the 2018 World Cup played in Russia.
